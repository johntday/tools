<h2>Language color and font style settings</h2>

<p>The UltraEdit versions prior v9.00 support up to 10 syntax highlighting languages per wordfile.
UltraEdit v9.00 to v14.20 and all versions of UEStudio up to v9.00 support up to 20&nbsp;languages
per wordfile. (Later versions of UltraEdit and UEStudio support also up to 20&nbsp;languages in a
single wordfile, but these versions use by default a wordfiles directory.) These versions save the
color and font style settings in the INI file or registry.<br>Here is an example of the settings
for the first syntax highlighting language in the INI file with the defaults of UltraEdit.</p>

<p><span class="maroon">[Language 1 Colors]</span><br>
Colors=0,<span style="color:#008080">8421376</span>,<span style="color:#008080">8421376</span>,<!--
--><span style="color:#808080">8421504</span>,<span style="color:#FF0000">255</span>,<!--
--><span style="color:#0000FF">16711680</span>,<span style="color:#FF0000">255</span>,<!--
--><span style="color:#FF8000">33023</span>,<span style="color:#008000">32768</span>,<!--
--><span style="color:#804040">4210816</span>,<span style="color:#0000FF">16711680</span>,<!--
--><span style="color:#0000FF">16711680</span>,<span style="color:#0000FF">16711680</span>,<br>
Colors Auto Back=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,<br>
Colors&nbsp;Back=16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,<br>
Font Style=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,</p>

<p>The first line <span class="blue">Colors=</span> contains the decimal values of the colors
for the 13 color groups:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Normal Text</li>
 <li>Comments</li>
 <li>Alternate Block Comments</li>
 <li>Strings</li>
 <li>Numbers</li>
 <li>Word List 1</li>
 <li>Word List 2</li>
 <li>Word List 3</li>
 <li>Word List 4</li>
 <li>Word List 5</li>
 <li>Word List 6</li>
 <li>Word List 7</li>
 <li>Word List 8</li>
</ol>

<p>The values can be calculated with following formula:</p>

<p style="margin-left:15px">Color value = <span class="blue">value of blue</span> * 65536 +
<span class="green">value of green</span> * 256 + <span class="red">value of red</span></p>

<p>The values are maybe easier to read after converting them to hexadecimal. For example the
decimal value 8404992 is hexadecimal <span class="blue">80</span><span class="green">40</span><!--
--><span class="red">00</span>. The first character pair of the hex value is the value of blue,
the second is for green and the third one for red. Please note that the color values in CSS files
or CSS sections are in reverse order: red, blue and green. The maximum value is 16777215 (FFFFFF)
which is the value of white. However, the colors can be specified easily in the syntax highlighting
configuration dialog. There is really no need to calculate the values manually.</p>

<p>The second line <span class="blue">Colors Auto Back=</span> contains the state of the setting
<strong>Background Color Automatic</strong> for the 13&nbsp;color groups. The values can be only
0 or 1. The default value of 1 means that the background color for this color group is the same
as specified for example at <strong>View - Set Colors</strong> for normal text background. A value
of 0 for a color group enables the special background color setting for this color group.</p>

<p>The third line <span class="blue">Colors Back=</span> contains the decimal color values of
the background colors for the 13&nbsp;color groups. A color value in this line gets active only
when the corresponding value in the line above is 0.</p>

<p>The fourth line <span class="blue">Font Style=</span> contains the font style settings for
the color groups. The possible values are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>0 ... normal</li>
 <li>1 ... bold</li>
 <li>2 ... italic</li>
 <li>3 ... underline</li>
</ul>

<p>The first value for color group <span class="maroon">Normal Text</span> is ignored and is always 0. When
using bold, italic or underline the font used should be a fixed pitch font. A fixed pitch font is a font
with same width for a letter in all styles. So for example a normal <span class="red">E</span> has the same
width as a bold <strong><span class="red">E</span></strong>, an italic <em><span class="red">E</span></em>
and an underlined <span class="red" style="text-decoration:underline">E</span>. If the font is additionally
also a mono-spaced font&nbsp;- all characters have the same width&nbsp;- or a proportional font&nbsp;-
each character has an individual width&nbsp;- is not so important when using the font styles for
syntax highlighting.</p>

<p>Here is an example how the settings above are stored in the registry:</p>

<p><span class="maroon">[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\IDM Computer Solutions\UltraEdit\Language 1 Colors]</span><br>
<span class="green">&quot;Colors&quot;="0,8421376,8421376,8421504,255,16711680,255,33023,32768,4210816,16711680,16711680,16711680,"<br>
&quot;Colors&nbsp;Back&quot;="16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,"<br>
&quot;Colors Auto Back&quot;="1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"<br>
&quot;Font Style&quot;="0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"</span></p>

<p><br>With UltraEdit v15.00 and UEStudio v9.10 the organization of syntax highlighting languages
has been changed. Instead of using only 1&nbsp;wordfile with up to 20&nbsp;languages the default for
new installations is now that UE/UES searches in a configured directory for wordfiles (*.uew) which
contain normally only 1&nbsp;language, but can contain also several languages. The language number
is not important anymore and there is no limit for the number of languages anymore. But for downwards
compatibility a single wordfile instead of a wordfiles directory is used further after an upgrade from
a previous version.</p>

<p>Because of this new management the color and font style settings of the languages are not stored
anymore in the INI file or registry. They are now stored in the wordfile itself for every language.
The settings are stored in the wordfile(s) as follows:</p>

<p>/Colors = 0,<span style="color:#008080">8421376</span>,<span style="color:#008080">8421376</span>,<!--
--><span style="color:#808080">8421504</span>,<span style="color:#FF0000">255</span><br>
/Colors Back = 16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,16777215,<br>
/Colors Auto Back = 1,1,1,1,1,<br>
/Font Style = 0,0,0,0,0,<br>
/C1 Colors = <span style="color:#0000FF">16711680</span> Colors Back = 16777215 Colors Auto Back = 1 Font Style = 0<br>
/C2 Colors = <span style="color:#FF0000">255</span> Colors Back = 16777215 Colors Auto Back = 1 Font Style = 0<br>
/C3 Colors = <span style="color:#FF8000">33023</span> Colors Back = 16777215 Colors Auto Back = 1 Font Style = 0<br>
/C4 Colors = <span style="color:#008000">32768</span> Colors Back = 16777215 Colors Auto Back = 1 Font Style = 0<br>
/C5 Colors = <span style="color:#804040">4210816</span> Colors Back = 16777215 Colors Auto Back = 1 Font Style = 0<br>
/C6 Colors = <span style="color:#0000FF">16711680</span> Colors Back = 16777215 Colors Auto Back = 1 Font Style = 0<br>
/C7 Colors = <span style="color:#0000FF">16711680</span> Colors Back = 16777215 Colors Auto Back = 1 Font Style = 0<br>
/C8 Colors = <span style="color:#0000FF">16711680</span> Colors Back = 16777215 Colors Auto Back = 1 Font Style = 0</p>

<p>The first four lines with the settings for the standard color groups <span class="maroon">Normal
Text</span>, <span class="maroon">Comments</span>, <span class="maroon">Alternate Block Comments</span>,
<span class="maroon">Strings</span> and <span class="maroon">Numbers</span> are stored in the wordfile
below the language definition line.</p>

<p>The settings for the color groups with the word lists are appended to the color group definition
lines starting with /C1&nbsp;- /C8 followed normally by the group name in double quotes and optionally
by a style keyword for the IntelliTip feature of UEStudio. With UltraEdit v17.00 and UEStudio v11.00
the number of color groups increased from 8 to 20. Therefore wordfiles for UltraEdit v17.00 or
UEStudio v11.00 or any later version can contain also color groups /C9&nbsp;- /C20.</p>

<p>Note: It is required that before and after every equal sign exactly 1 space character exists.
And the names of the settings are case sensitive.</p>

<p>On first start after an upgrade from a previous version the language settings are copied from the INI or
registry into the wordfile and saved on exit in the wordfile. Every <span class="maroon">[Language</span>
<span class="red">x</span> <span class="maroon">Colors]</span> section once copied into a wordfile is
automatically completely removed from the INI or registry. So normally after first start (more precisely
exit) of UE/UES after an upgrade the INI or registry contains only the language color sections of languages
not found in the wordfile. Those color sections can be deleted manually from the INI or registry.</p>


<div><hr></div>


<h2>Managing the wordfiles and their settings</h2>

<p>UltraEdit v15.00 or UEStudio v9.10 and later are installed with standard wordfiles (*.uew) in
a subdirectory named <span class="blue">wordfiles</span> in the program directory of UE/UES. These
wordfiles contain no color and font style settings. On start of UE/UES the whole wordfiles directory
is copied to &quot;<span class="blue">%appdata%\IDMComp\UltraEdit\</span>&quot; respectively
&quot;<span class="blue">%appdata%\IDMComp\UEStudio\</span>&quot; if such a directory does not
already exist. This directory is also set as wordfiles directory in the INI file or registry.
A different directory can be specified in the syntax highlighting configuration dialog.</p>

<p>The procedure as written above is also executed when upgrading from UltraEdit prior
v15.00 or UEStudio prior v9.10 with one exception: the path to the wordfile in the INI
file or registry is not modified and the wordfile from the previous version is used further.</p>


<p><br><strong>ATTENTION!</strong></p>

<p>The macros are not working correct when the setting &quot;<em>Automatically copy to clipboard when selection
is made</em>&quot; at <strong>Configuration - Editor - Miscellaneous</strong> is enabled. Uncheck this setting
before running any macro. And also disable word-wrap mode if word-wrap is enabled for the wordfile or by
default for new (temporary) files.</p>

<p>Maybe you are a user who upgraded from a previous version and you want to use now also
several wordfiles in a wordfiles directory instead of 1&nbsp;wordfile with several languages.
In this case the macro <strong>SplitToWordfiles</strong> is for you. It is very easy to use.</p>

<p><strong>How to use SplitToWordfiles?</strong></p>

<ol>
 <li>Open your wordfile in UltraEdit / UEStudio. The full name of the wordfile currently used can
  be seen in <strong>Advanced - Configuration - Editor Display - Syntax Highlighting</strong>.</li>
 <li>Load the macro file <span class="maroon">SyntaxTools.mac</span> via <strong>Macro - Load</strong>.</li>
 <li>Run the macro <strong>SplitToWordfiles</strong> via <strong>Macro - Play Any/Multiple Times</strong>
  with the value <span class="red">1</span> for <em>Specify number of times to repeat macro</em>
  and option <em>Play macro to End of File</em> unchecked.<br>
  Or click on <strong>View - Views/Lists - Macro List</strong> to open the macro list view if not
  already open and double click on the macro <strong>SplitToWordfiles</strong> to execute it.</li>
 <li>You will have now lots of new files depending on the number of languages in your wordfile.
  Save every wordfile with an appropriate file name and the extension <strong>uew</strong> in a
  directory of your choice.</li>
 <li>Open the syntax highlighting configuration or the project settings dialog and specify the
  directory with your wordfiles for being used in future.</li>
</ol>


<div><hr class="w50"></div>


<p>The opposite of <em>SplitToWordfiles</em> is the macro <strong>WordfilesMerger</strong>. This
macro can be useful for all UE/UES users independent of the version they use. It is mainly written to
merge the contents of several wordfiles into one wordfile. But it does not only copy the contents of
all open wordfiles into a new file. It also renumbers the languages by keeping the existing language
number as much as possible. And all languages with language number&nbsp;20 get automatically the next
free language number. And in the last step the macro re-orders the syntax highlighting languages.</p>

<p>So the macro <strong>WordfilesMerger</strong> can be used with a single wordfile
open just for re-ordering the languages in this wordfile (done in a new file).</p>

<p>It can be used to append a downloaded wordfile to an existing wordfile with 1 or more languages as
explained in the power tip <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/support/tutorials_power_tips/ultraedit/add_a_wordfile_pre_v15.html">Adding
a wordfile in UltraEdit pre v15.00</a> or in the <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=5720">Readme
for the Syntax Highlighting forum</a> a little bit more comfortable.</p>

<p>Or it is used for example to create a project specific wordfile by opening all wordfiles required
for a project and running this macro.</p>

<p><strong>How to use WordfilesMerger?</strong></p>

<ol>
 <li>Open the wordfiles of which contents you want to copy into a new wordfile. Other files can be
  open too which are ignored by the macro. But better is definitely to have only wordfiles open.</li>
 <li>Load the macro file <span class="maroon">SyntaxTools.mac</span> via <strong>Macro - Load</strong>.</li>
 <li>Run the macro <strong>WordfilesMerger</strong> via <strong>Macro - Play Any/Multiple Times</strong>
  with the value <span class="red">1</span> for <em>Specify number of times to repeat macro</em>
  and option <em>Play macro to End of File</em> unchecked.<br>
  Or click on <strong>View - Views/Lists - Macro List</strong> to open the macro list view if not
  already open and double click on the macro <strong>WordfilesMerger</strong> to execute it.</li>
 <li>You will have now a new file with all the languages of the wordfiles, possibly renumbered
  partly or completely and correct ordered according to the language number. Save the wordfile
  with an appropriate file name.</li>
 <li>Open the syntax highlighting configuration or the project settings dialog and specify this
  wordfile for being used in future.</li>
</ol>


<div><hr class="w50"></div>


<p>You are using UltraEdit v15.00 or UEStudio v9.10 or any later and you want to publish a wordfile
you have created for example by sending it by email to IDM for their download area. Or you want to
give your wordfile(s) somebody else which uses a different color scheme than you. In this case the
macro <strong>SettingsDelAll</strong> should be used. It deletes all the color and font style
settings from the wordfile currently open and active.</p>

<p><strong>How to use SettingsDelAll?</strong></p>

<ol>
 <li>Open the wordfile in UltraEdit / UEStudio.</li>
 <li>Load the macro file <span class="maroon">SyntaxTools.mac</span> via <strong>Macro - Load</strong>.</li>
 <li>Run the macro <strong>SettingsDelAll</strong> via <strong>Macro - Play Any/Multiple Times</strong>
  with the value <span class="red">1</span> for <em>Specify number of times to repeat macro</em>
  and option <em>Play macro to End of File</em> unchecked.<br>
  Or click on <strong>View - Views/Lists - Macro List</strong> to open the macro list view if not
  already open and double click on the macro <strong>SettingsDelAll</strong> to execute it.</li>
 <li>You will have now a wordfile without any settings like the wordfiles used by UltraEdit prior
  v15.00 or UEStudio prior v9.10. Save the wordfile with a new name of your choice.</li>
</ol>


<div><hr class="w50"></div>


<p>The macro <strong>SettingsDelCur</strong> is similar <em>SettingsDelAll</em>. It also removes all
color and font style settings, but only for the language the cursor is currently set instead of the
entire wordfile. If a wordfile contains only one language, it makes no difference which macro is
executed: <em>SettingsDelAll</em> or <em>SettingsDelCur</em>, except <em>SettingsDelAll</em> is much
faster. <em>SettingsDelCur</em> is used also by the macro <em>SettingsCopyCur</em> explained later
in this document.</p>

<p><strong>How to use SettingsDelCur?</strong></p>

<ol>
 <li>Open the wordfile in UltraEdit / UEStudio and set the cursor at start or anywhere inside the
  syntax highlighting language of which the color and font style settings should be removed.</li>
 <li>Load the macro file <span class="maroon">SyntaxTools.mac</span> via <strong>Macro - Load</strong>.</li>
 <li>Run the macro <strong>SettingsDelCur</strong> via <strong>Macro - Play Any/Multiple Times</strong>
  with the value <span class="red">1</span> for <em>Specify number of times to repeat macro</em>
  and option <em>Play macro to End of File</em> unchecked.<br>
  Or click on <strong>View - Views/Lists - Macro List</strong> to open the macro list view if not
  already open and double click on the macro <strong>SettingsDelCur</strong> to execute it.</li>
</ol>


<div><hr class="w50"></div>


<p>In UltraEdit prior v15.00 and UEStudio prior v9.10 the color scheme of a syntax highlighting
language was stored as a section in the INI file or registry. Therefore it was quite simple to
apply a preferred color scheme to all languages by simply replicating the block for every language.
Also copying a color scheme into a new file and give this file to somebody else which want the color
scheme too was no problem.</p>

<p>Now with the color scheme saved individually in the wordfile it is possible to share or distribute
more easily the wordfile of a syntax highlighting language together with the color and font style
settings. That is great for example for a team working on a project where the members want to use
all the same color scheme too.</p>

<p>But with the color scheme saved in the wordfile it is not so easy anymore to apply a preferred
language color scheme to a wordfile got from a team member, colleague or friend, or downloaded for
example from <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/downloads/extras.html">Downloads&nbsp;- Extras</a>.
It is also more difficult to share with somebody else only the language color scheme.</p>

<p>The macros <strong>SettingsCopyAll</strong>, <strong>SettingsCopyCur</strong> and
<strong>SettingsExtract</strong> are written to help you to manage the language color
settings in wordfiles of UltraEdit v15.00 or UEStudio v9.10 or any later.</p>


<p><br>The macro <strong>SettingsExtract</strong> copies the color and font style settings of
one language in the wordfile into a new file which can be saved for example with the extension
<span class="maroon">uesh</span>. This file can be used later by yourself for new wordfiles or
to share the language color scheme with somebody else.</p>

<p><strong>How to use SettingsExtract?</strong></p>

<ol>
 <li>Open the wordfile in UltraEdit / UEStudio and set the cursor at start or anywhere inside the
  syntax highlighting language of which the color and font style settings should be extracted.</li>
 <li>Load the macro file <span class="maroon">SyntaxTools.mac</span> via <strong>Macro - Load</strong>.</li>
 <li>Run the macro <strong>SettingsExtract</strong> via <strong>Macro - Play Any/Multiple Times</strong>
  with the value <span class="red">1</span> for <em>Specify number of times to repeat macro</em>
  and option <em>Play macro to End of File</em> unchecked.<br>
  Or click on <strong>View - Views/Lists - Macro List</strong> to open the macro list view if not
  already open and double click on the macro <strong>SettingsExtract</strong> to execute it.</li>
 <li>Save the new file with just the language color scheme in the wordfile format with a name of
  your choice, for example as *.uesh (UltraEdit Syntax Highlighting color scheme).</li>
</ol>


<div><hr class="w50"></div>


<p>The macro <strong>SettingsCopyAll</strong> copies the color and font style settings in the
wordfile format for example from a *.uesh file created before by you or somebody else with the macro
<em>SettingsExtract</em> to all languages in a wordfile. It is also possible to use another wordfile
as color scheme source instead of a file containing only the color scheme. But it is recommended to
use a syntax highlighting color scheme file as source file. With this macro you can easily apply your
preferred language color scheme to all languages in a wordfile, or when you run it multiple times,
to all wordfiles you use. It does not matter if the wordfile contains already color settings or not.
Existing color settings are automatically completely deleted before copying the new color settings
to all languages in the wordfile.</p>

<p><strong>How to use SettingsCopyAll?</strong></p>

<ol>
 <li>Save and close all files currently open in UltraEdit / UEStudio or open a new instance.</li>
 <li>Open the wordfile in UltraEdit / UEStudio into which you want to copy the color settings.</li>
 <li>Open the file containing the color scheme you want to copy. Make sure that this file has
  now the focus if it was already open.</li>
 <li>Load the macro file <span class="maroon">SyntaxTools.mac</span> via <strong>Macro - Load</strong>.</li>
 <li>Run the macro <strong>SettingsCopyAll</strong> via <strong>Macro - Play Any/Multiple Times</strong>
  with the value <span class="red">1</span> for <em>Specify number of times to repeat macro</em>
  and option <em>Play macro to End of File</em> unchecked.<br>
  Or click on <strong>View - Views/Lists - Macro List</strong> to open the macro list view if not
  already open and double click on the macro <strong>SettingsCopyAll</strong> to execute it.</li>
 <li>Save the wordfile with the new language color scheme copied to all languages in the wordfile.</li>
</ol>


<div><hr class="w50"></div>


<p>The macro <strong>SettingsCopyCur</strong> is similar <em>SettingsCopyAll</em>. The difference is
that the color settings are copied only to the language the cursor is currently set instead of all
languages in the entire wordfile. If a wordfile contains only one language, it makes no difference which
macro is executed: <em>SettingsCopyAll</em> or <em>SettingsCopyCur</em>, except <em>SettingsCopyAll</em>
is faster. Existing color settings for the current language are automatically completely deleted by
playing macro <em>SettingsDelCur</em> before copying the new color settings to the current language
in the wordfile.</p>

<p><strong>How to use SettingsCopyCur?</strong></p>

<ol>
 <li>Save and close all files currently open in UltraEdit / UEStudio or open a new instance.</li>
 <li>Open the wordfile in UltraEdit / UEStudio into which you want to copy the color settings.</li>
 <li>Set the cursor at start or anywhere inside the syntax highlighting language to which the
  color and font style settings should be copied.</li>
 <li>Open the file containing the color scheme you want to copy. Make sure that this file has
  now the focus if it was already open.</li>
 <li>Load the macro file <span class="maroon">SyntaxTools.mac</span> via <strong>Macro - Load</strong>.</li>
 <li>Run the macro <strong>SettingsCopyCur</strong> via <strong>Macro - Play Any/Multiple Times</strong>
  with the value <span class="red">1</span> for <em>Specify number of times to repeat macro</em>
  and option <em>Play macro to End of File</em> unchecked.<br>
  Or click on <strong>View - Views/Lists - Macro List</strong> to open the macro list view if not
  already open and double click on the macro <strong>SettingsCopyCur</strong> to execute it.</li>
 <li>Save the wordfile with the new language color scheme copied to the current language.</li>
</ol>


<div><hr class="w50"></div>


<p>But what to do when you upgraded from a previous version of UltraEdit or UEStudio and UE/UES has not
copied the color and font style settings into your wordfile or you lost the settings in the wordfile(s)?
If you still have a copy of the INI file containing the sections with the language colors and font style
settings you have luck because you can use the macro <strong>SettingsCopyIni</strong> to copy the settings
from the INI file into the wordfile(s). Please note that this macro supports only up to 8&nbsp;color groups
while all others support up to 20&nbsp;color groups because more colors are not stored in the INI file.</p>

<p><strong>How to use SettingsCopyIni?</strong></p>

<ol>
 <li>Save and close all files currently open in UltraEdit / UEStudio or open a new instance.</li>
 <li>Open the INI file containing the sections <strong>[Language <span class="red">x</span> Colors]</strong>
  with <span class="red">x</span> is a number in the range of 1 to 20. It is important that this file has
  the file extension INI in any case.</li>
 <li>Open the wordfile in UltraEdit / UEStudio into which you want to copy the color settings. It does
  not matter which file extension this wordfile has.</li>
 <li>Save this wordfile to a temporary directory with the same name. Do not run the macro on a wordfile
  currently in use by UE/UES. It could happen that the color and font style settings copied by the macro
  into the wordfile are replaced on exit of UltraEdit with the current settings in memory. Therefore run
  the macro on a copy of the wordfile in a different directory.</li>
 <li>Load the macro file <span class="maroon">SyntaxTools.mac</span> via <strong>Macro - Load</strong>.</li>
 <li>Set the cursor at start or anywhere inside the syntax highlighting language to which the color and
  font style settings should be copied. It does not matter if this language already contains (wrong)
  color and font style settings. These settings are automatically removed by the macro before copying
  the settings from the INI file.</li>
 <li>Run the macro <strong>SettingsCopyIni</strong> via <strong>Macro - Play Any/Multiple Times</strong>
  with the value <span class="red">1</span> for <em>Specify number of times to repeat macro</em>
  and option <em>Play macro to End of File</em> unchecked.<br>
  Or click on <strong>View - Views/Lists - Macro List</strong> to open the macro list view if not
  already open and double click on the macro <strong>SettingsCopyIni</strong> to execute it.</li>
 <li>If you have other languages in the wordfile redo the steps 6. and 7. for every language in the
  wordfile. You can't run the macro simply several times because the macro positions always the cursor
  to start of the language which was updated so that you can easily control if everything is correct
  after macro execution. Running the macro simply multiple times would result in just updating the
  same language several times.</li>
 <li>Save the wordfile and close all instances of UE/UES.</li>
 <li>Cut the updated wordfile in the temporary directory and paste it over the wordfile loaded by
  UltraEdit&nbsp;/ UEStudio.</li>
